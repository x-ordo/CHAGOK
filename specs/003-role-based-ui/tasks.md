## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 completion (role routing)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US2 completion (lawyer layout)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (client role)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 completion (detective role)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US4 and US5 (messaging between roles)
- **User Story 7 (Phase 9)**: Depends on US2 (lawyer portal)
- **User Story 8 (Phase 10)**: Depends on US4 (client billing view)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
US1 (Roles) ──┬── US2 (Lawyer Dashboard) ── US3 (Case Mgmt) ── US7 (Calendar)
              │                                              └── US8 (Billing)
              ├── US4 (Client Portal) ──────────────┬── US6 (Messaging)
              └── US5 (Detective Portal) ───────────┘
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T006 || T007 || T008 || T009 - Different models

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T014 || T015 - Different files

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T022 || T023 || T024 || T025 - Different components

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- T033 || T034 || T035 || T036 - Different components

**Phase 6 (US4)**:
- T048 || T049 || T050 || T051 - Different components

**Phase 7 (US5)**:
- T063 || T064 || T065 || T066 || T067 - Different components

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US1 + US2 + US3)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (roles, models)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (role authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (lawyer dashboard)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (case management)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test lawyer portal functionality
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational + US1 → Role system ready
2. Add US2 + US3 → Lawyer Portal MVP (Demo 1)
3. Add US4 → Client Portal (Demo 2)
4. Add US5 → Detective Portal (Demo 3)
5. Add US6 + US7 → Cross-cutting features (Demo 4)
6. Add US8 → Billing (Demo 5)

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Phase 5** = Minimum Viable Role-Based UI

This delivers:
- Role-based authentication (CLIENT, DETECTIVE)
- Lawyer dashboard with statistics
- Case list with filtering
- Case detail with evidence view
- Role-specific routing
